# Nothing - A Simple To-Do List Directory Manager with Extensions

**Nothing** is an app-less task manager whose UI is your filesystem.
Please see [the project page](https://adamgrant.info/nothing) to learn about this tool.
For technical documentation, quickstart, and expanded usage, see [the documentation](https://adamgrant.info/nothing-documentation).

# Run tests

First `bundle install --path vendor/bundle` to install the necessary gems.

The Gemfile is only needed for tests, not for Nothing itself.

```bash
bundle exec ruby _nothing/test.rb
```
